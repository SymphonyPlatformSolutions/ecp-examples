#ECP integration examples

This repository contains some examples of how to integrate ECP into your application. Under the DocumentSupport folder, you will find some very basic HTML/JS examples of the different features of the ECP integration: in an iframe, with an SDK and with custom properties.
The AppExamples folder contains more complex applications. The CleverDeal application for instance demonstrates how to integrate ECP into a React application.
